# gRPC-on-.NET
gRPC is a language agnostic, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

The main benefits of gRPC are:

- Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
- Contract-first API development, using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
- Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
- Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
-Reduced network usage with Protobuf binary serialization.

These benefits make gRPC ideal for:

- Lightweight microservices where efficiency is critical.
- Polyglot systems where multiple languages are required for development.
- Point-to-point real-time services that need to handle streaming requests or responses.
